VNoticing the new phone is named \u201ciPhone SE\u201d not \u201ciPhone 6se\u201d - wondering if Apple intends to drop the numbering from the iPhone line
p2
aVEverything for sale isn't for everybody. That iPhone 6SE will do numbers, trust.
p3
aV[JUST IN] Apple unveils the new iPhone 6se - It's a 4" iPhone. 4K Video, Always on hey-siri, better microphones, battery and camera.
p4
aVNow, my problem is: Do I sell the iPhone 6 and get a 6SE which is far more to my taste? Or wait for contract roll-over and get the 7SE?
p5
aVgetting the iphone C 6SE plus 4
p6
aVSo wanted an iPhone 6SE. I'm still on the 5S, so would'a been neat. But: Only available in 64GB, which is my current phone, which is full.
p7
aVAesthetically the iPhone 5S design was way better the 6. Def copping the 6SE
p8
aViPhone 6SE makes no damn sense! It's literally a 5S \U0001f610\U0001f610\U0001f610\U0001f610\U0001f610
p9
aViPhone 6se I'm liking this one Apple \U0001f44c\U0001f44d\U0001f44a
p10
aVWill the next iPhone be the 6SE instead of 7?

p12
aVRT @Tomidivide: The new iPhone 6se looks smart.
p13
aVwhy is Apple making an  iPhone 6SE ? \U0001f62d
p14
aV@TChanaH meh, I think Apple is now fucking up with their naming scheme. Why didn't they name their new iPhone 6SE or iPhone 6 mini?
p15
aVHey @verizon not to rush you....but I need the new iPhone 6SE. \U0001f601\U0001f601 I've held onto my 5S just for this...so yeah...rush\u000a\u000aPlease and thank you.
